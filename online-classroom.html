                The online classroom is a new environment to the world where people can take classes from Primmary school to college. 
                This is a new way of learning that has been around for a few years. 
                This new medium has allowed people to learn from home with teachers and professors, in contrast to only being able to learn by oneself at home. 
                This new medium has expanded peoples opportunity to learn and expand knowledge. </p>
                <p>
                However the difficulties that come with this new medium is uncharted territory for many. 
                No matter one's race, age or any other factor, obstacles can appear for any individual. 
                But, how does one overcome these obstacles? That is the question being tackled on this page.
