                Having a safe space where one can study is greatly influential for the entirety of a persons studying. 
                Knowing which environment is best for you is key to having a successful study session. 
                Some people may prefer a quiet space, while others may prefer a more lively space. 
                Some people may prefer to study in a group, while others may prefer to study alone. 
                Knowing which environment is best for you is key to having a successful study session. 
                Whether it be complete silence in a library or the light backfround noise of a coffee shop. 
                The key is knowing oneself as an individual studyer.</p>
